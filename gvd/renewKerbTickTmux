Logging out destroys your ticket . you need to somehow:

Find it
Copy it
point your kerberos libs to it
keep renewing it (optional).
For 1 klist will help : first line says ticket cache: 2 depends on 1, if it is FILE:/tmp/krb5_XXXXXXX of DIR:/SOME/PATH all you have to do is copy it:

cp /tmp/krb5_XXXXXXX /tmp/krb5_tmux_XXXXXXX) 
Make sure that only you can read it.

For 3 set env var KRB5CCNAME to FILE:/tmp/krb5_tmux_XXXXXXX:

export KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5_tmux_XXXXXXX
step 4 can be achieved with krenew from the kstart package (look it up)
